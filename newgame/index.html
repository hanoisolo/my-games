                <h3>Objective:</h3>
                <p>The goal is simple: survive the game! Be the last player standing who hasn't been eliminated by reaching the shot limit, OR have the fewest shots taken when all the tiles run out.</p>

                <h3>Game Setup:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Number of Players:</strong> Use the <code>▼</code> and <code>▲</code> buttons to select the number of players (minimum 2, maximum 8).</li>
                    <li><strong>Player Names:</strong> Enter a unique name for each player in the fields provided.</li>
                    <li><strong>Max Shots:</strong> Set the maximum number of shots a player can take before being eliminated. If a player reaches this number, they are out of the game! Set this to <code>0</code> for unlimited shots (no elimination based on shot count).</li>
                    <li><strong>Alternatives Per Player:</strong> Set the starting number of times each player can choose to do an alternative activity instead of taking shots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Start Game:</strong> Once everything is set, click "Start Game"!</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Turns:</strong> The game proceeds in turns. The "Current Turn" indicator at the top shows whose turn it is. Players who are eliminated ("OUT") will be skipped automatically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Picking a Tile:</strong> On your turn, click any <em>unrevealed</em> tile on the grid (the ones showing a number).</li>
                    <li><strong>Revealing the Action:</strong> The tile will flip over, revealing an action. The action text will also appear below the grid.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performing the Action:</strong> Follow the instructions on the tile. See "Tile Actions Explained" below for details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Next Turn:</strong> After the action is completed (and any choices are made), the turn passes to the next player in the current play direction.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Tile Actions Explained:</h3>
                <p>Tiles hide various actions. Here's what to expect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Take Shots (e.g., "Take 1 Shot", "Take 2 Shots"):</strong> The player whose turn it is must take the specified number of shots OR choose the alternative activity (if available, see below).</li>
                    <li><strong>Assign Shots (Positional - e.g., "Person to your Left takes 1 shot"):</strong> The player to the immediate left/right (following the current play direction) takes the shot(s) OR chooses the alternative activity (if available). If that player is already out, the action has no effect.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assign Shots (Targeted - e.g., "Choose someone to take 2 shots"):</strong> A modal window will pop up. The current player chooses another active player from the list to take the shot(s) OR do the alternative activity (if available).</li>
                    <li><strong>Social! (Everyone drinks 1):</strong> All players <em>currently in the game</em> (not "OUT") must take 1 shot. <em>Note: For simplicity, the "Social!" action currently does <strong>not</strong> offer the alternative activity option.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Safe!:</strong> Lucky you! Nothing happens. Your turn ends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reverse Play Order:</strong> The direction of play reverses (clockwise becomes counter-clockwise, and vice-versa). This affects who is "left" and "right" for other tiles! The display will briefly note the change.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skip Your Next Turn:</strong> The player whose turn it is will miss their <em>next</em> turn when it comes around again.</li>
                    <li><strong>Immunity for next shot assigned to you:</strong> The player gains Immunity. This automatically blocks the <em>next</em> set of shots <em>assigned to them where they choose the "Take Shot(s)" option</em>. Immunity is used up once it blocks shots. It does <em>not</em> protect against "Social!" and is not used if the player chooses the "Do Activity" alternative. You'll see "(Immune)" next to the player's name while active.</li>
                    <li><strong>Waterfall (3 seconds):</strong> A mini-game!
                        <ul>
                           <li>On the count of three, <em>everyone currently in the game</em> (not "OUT") starts drinking their beverage simultaneously.</li>
                           <li>The player who revealed the tile drinks for about 3 seconds and then <strong>must stop</strong> drinking. They signal they have stopped (e.g., by putting their drink down or saying "Stopped!").</li>
                           <li>The player to their left (following the current play direction) <strong>must keep drinking</strong> until the first player (the one who revealed the tile) has stopped. Only <em>after</em> the first player stops can the second player choose to stop drinking whenever they wish.</li>
                           <li>The third player (to the left of the second player) <strong>must keep drinking</strong> until the <em>second</em> player has stopped drinking. Only then can the third player choose to stop.</li>
                           <li>This continues around the circle. <strong>Crucially: You cannot stop drinking until the person immediately preceding you in the waterfall chain has stopped drinking.</strong></li>
                           <li>The last person in the chain might end up drinking the longest, depending on when everyone else decides to stop!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Categories (Loser takes 1 shot):</strong> A mini-game!
                        <ul>
                            <li>The player who revealed the tile chooses a category (e.g., "Types of Cars", "Breakfast Cereals", "Movie Stars").</li>
                            <li>Starting with the player to their left, each player names something within that category.</li>
                            <li>You cannot repeat an answer already given.</li>
                            <li>The first player to hesitate too long, repeat an answer, or give an invalid answer "loses".</li>
                            <li>The loser takes 1 shot OR does an alternative activity (if available, player-enforced).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Make a Rule (Lasts until next rule):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The player who revealed the tile gets to make a new rule for the game (e.g., "You can only drink with your left hand", "No saying the word 'drink'", "Thumbmaster - last person to put their thumb on the table drinks").</li>
                            <li>A prompt will appear to enter the rule.</li>
                            <li>Decide on a penalty for breaking the rule (usually 1 shot or an activity).</li>
                            <li>This rule stays in effect until <em>another</em> "Make a Rule" tile is revealed or the game ends. The current rule (if any) is displayed below the grid.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                 <h3>Alternative Activity Option:</h3>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Each player starts with a set number of "Alts" (alternatives).</li>
                    <li>Whenever a player is assigned shots (Take, Left/Right, Choose Someone, Mini-Game penalties), a modal window will appear.</li>
                    <li>If the player has **Alts Left > 0**, they will see two options:
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Take Shot(s):</strong> The player takes the assigned shots. Immunity (if held) will be used automatically.</li>
                            <li><strong>Do an Activity Instead:</strong> The player performs a random activity. They do **not** take shots, Immunity is **not** used, and their "Alts Left" count decreases by 1.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                     <li>If the player has **Alts Left = 0**, the "Do an Activity Instead" option will **not** appear. They must choose "Take Shot(s)".</li>
                    <li><em>Exception:</em> The "Social!" tile currently does not offer this choice regardless of Alts Left.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Elimination (Max Shots):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a "Max Shots" limit was set at the start (and it's not 0), any player who takes a shot that brings their total <em>equal to or over* the limit is immediately **OUT**.</li>
                    <li>Their status changes, they cannot take any more turns or be assigned shots/activities, and they cannot win (unless everyone gets out).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Winning the Game:</h3>
                <p>The game ends when one of these happens:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Last Player Standing:</strong> If all players except one have been eliminated (by reaching the Max Shots limit), the remaining player is the winner!</li>
                    <li><strong>All Tiles Revealed:</strong> If all tiles are flipped over before a single winner emerges:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The player(s) still <em>in</em> the game (not "OUT") with the <em>lowest</em> total shots taken wins.</li>
                            <li>If multiple players are tied for the lowest score, they all win!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Mutual Destruction:</strong> If all players get eliminated (e.g., the last two players reach the shot limit simultaneously), there is no winner.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Play Again:</h3>
                <p>After the game ends, click the "Play Again" button on the results screen to return to the setup and start a new game!</p>
