# Games Hub Project

This repository hosts a collection of simple web-based games, perfect for a bit of fun!

## Games Overview

###  Games Hub (`index.html`)

This is the main landing page for the project. It provides a central hub from which you can navigate to the different games available in this collection.

### Lucky Grid Pick (`luckygrid.html`)

This is a simple game of chance. Players take turns clicking on squares in a grid to reveal their assigned "departure time." The game is currently set up for players: Dee, Anokhi, Seema, and Bruce.

### Deal or No Drink (`newgame/`)

Located in the `newgame/` directory, this is a web-based drinking game. It includes features such as player name setup, customizable rules (like maximum shots), a tile-based grid that triggers various actions, and a detailed "How to Play" guide accessible within the game.
